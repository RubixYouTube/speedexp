Hello, this contains a mobile supportive file. basically speedycollab but mobile.
# instructions on how to install it.
so first run ```pkg upgrade -y```  
and then ```pkg i wget python -y```  
And then ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubixYouTube/speedexp/refs/heads/main/SpeedExp.py```  
but if you have a existing copy of it, just do ```rm SpeedExp.py && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubixYouTube/speedexp/refs/heads/main/SpeedExp.py```  
And then ```python SpeedExp.py``` or something similar than that.  
Enjoy!
## troubleshooting
if you have a big watermaek, maybe you changed the watermark parameters, refresh to default by doing `rm SpeedyExp.py && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RubixYouTube/speedexp/refs/heads/main/SpeedExp.py`. but if you still have that, report it into issues tab.  
if you have big text, decrease it using the text size option.
